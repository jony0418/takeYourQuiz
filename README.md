# Timed Coding Quiz Challenge
This timed coding quiz is a fun and interactive web application designed to test your knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML fundamentals. You have 60 seconds to answer a series of questions, and each incorrect answer deducts 10 seconds from your remaining time. At the end of the quiz, you can save your score by entering your initials.
